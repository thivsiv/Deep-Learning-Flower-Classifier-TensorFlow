## Project Overview

This repository contains a deep learning model designed to classify flower images into predefined categories. The model is trained using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, with a dataset containing labeled images of flowers such as **daisy**, **dandelion**, **rose**, **sunflower**, and **tulip**. The model can be deployed for real-time flower classification applications.

---

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies images of flowers into categories such as **daisy**, **dandelion**, **rose**, **sunflower**, and **tulip**.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Utilizes CNN for effective feature extraction and classification.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: Built with TensorFlow and Keras, providing easy integration and scalability.
- **Model Storage**: The trained model is saved as a `.h5` file, which can be used for inference in real-time applications.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thivsiv/Deep-Learning-Flower-Classifier-TensorFlow.git
cd Deep-Learning-Flower-Classifier-TensorFlow
```

### Set Up Virtual Environment

It is recommended to set up a virtual environment for this project to manage dependencies.

#### Create a Virtual Environment
To create a virtual environment, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

#### Activate the Virtual Environment

- **For Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **For macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

Once activated, your terminal prompt should change to indicate that you're working inside the virtual environment.

### Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have the `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the dependencies as follows:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python pillow tensorflow-datasets
```

### Verify Installation

To verify that TensorFlow and other dependencies are installed correctly, you can run the following Python command to check TensorFlow's version:
```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

This should return the installed version of TensorFlow.

## Usage

### Load the Dataset

To load the dataset, run the `load.py` script:
```bash
python load.py
```
This script:
- Loads the **tf_flowers** dataset using `tensorflow_datasets`.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Train the Model

To train the model, run the following command:
```bash
python flower_classifier_model.py
```

This will initiate the training process, where the model will learn from the dataset and be saved as `flower_classifier_model.h5`.

### Model Inference

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new flower images. Run:
```bash
python test_model.py flower_classifier_model.h5 "path/to/flower_image.jpg"
```
The model will classify the image and return the flower category along with the confidence score.

---

## Model Details

The model is based on a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture, effective for image classification tasks. The steps involved in this project include:

### Data Preprocessing
- Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to improve the model's ability to generalize.

### Model Architecture
- A CNN with multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

### Training
- The model is trained using a **categorical cross-entropy** loss function with the **Adam optimizer**.

### Model Evaluation
- After training, the model is evaluated on a test set for accuracy.

The trained model is saved as `flower_classifier_model.h5`.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- **TensorFlow** >= 2.0
- **Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **scikit-learn**
- **OpenCV**
- **Pillow**
- **TensorFlow Datasets**

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can manually install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python pillow tensorflow-datasets
```

## Scripts Overview

### `load.py`

This script loads the **tf_flowers** dataset and splits it into training and testing datasets.

#### Code Example:
```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

# Load the tf_flowers dataset
dataset, dataset_info = tfds.load("tf_flowers", as_supervised=True, with_info=True)

# Print dataset information
print(dataset_info)

# Split the dataset into training and testing
train_data = dataset['train'].take(3500)  # Use 3500 images for training
test_data = dataset['train'].skip(3500)  # Use remaining images for testing
```

### `flower_classifier_model.py`

This script trains the CNN model on the **tf_flowers** dataset and saves the trained model as `flower_classifier_model.h5`.

### `test_model.py`

This script loads the trained model and performs inference on a given flower image.

## Notes and Recommendations

1. Ensure that the images used for training and testing are clear and properly labeled.
2. While running the test script (`test_model.py`), provide the correct path to the image file and model.
3. If using a GPU, verify that the CUDA drivers and cuDNN libraries are properly installed to optimize performance.

Feel free to expand the repository by adding more flower categories or improving the model architecture for better accuracy! ðŸ˜Š
